# Paul's Thought Blog Repository

I'm Paul Paterson, a software engineer, dad, husband, and fixer of things! I am passionate about building, whether it&apos;s with code or with my hands. Sometimes I write about it.

This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

See it live at [paul.patersons.us](https://paul.patersons.us)

## Development

Clone the repo and start the development server. Turbo pack is current not compatible with this app.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Blog pages can be added simply by adding additional `.mdx` files to the [src/blogs/](./src/blogs/) folder.
